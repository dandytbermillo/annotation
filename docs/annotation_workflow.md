Annotation Creation Workflow (User Experience)
1. Text Selection

User highlights any text within a panel's content area
The selected text becomes visually highlighted on the screen

2. Annotation Menu Appears

A small toolbar pops up near the cursor with three colored buttons:

Note (blue) - for detailed analysis or additional information
Explore (orange) - for further investigation or research directions
Promote (green) - for important insights or key findings



3. Annotation Type Selection

User clicks one of the three annotation type buttons
The selected text immediately transforms into a colored, styled annotation within the original text
The annotation becomes clickable and shows visual styling matching its type

4. Branch Entry Auto-Creation

A new branch item automatically appears in the parent panel's branches section on the right
The branch entry shows the annotation type icon and a truncated title from the selected text
The branch preview displays the beginning of the default content
The entry becomes clickable - when clicked, it will open/focus the corresponding panel (once created)

5. New Panel Creation

A new panel automatically appears to the right of the current panel
The new panel contains the selected text as a quoted reference at the top
Below the quote is an editable content area for expanding on the annotation

6. Panel Features Activation

The new panel can be dragged around the canvas by its header
Content in the panel can be edited directly with auto-save
A breadcrumb trail shows the path from the main document to this annotation
The panel includes its own branches section for creating sub-annotations

7. Visual Connections

A colored curved line connects the parent panel to the new annotation panel
The connection color matches the annotation type (blue/orange/green)
Lines dynamically adjust when panels are moved around

8. Navigation & Organization

The view smoothly pans to show the newly created panel
The original annotation in the parent text remains interactive
Hovering over annotations shows preview popups with branch content
The minimap updates to show the new panel's location

9. Ongoing Workflow

Users can create additional annotations within the new panel
Multiple levels of nested annotations are supported
Filter buttons allow viewing only specific types of annotations
All panels remain interconnected through the visual connection system
